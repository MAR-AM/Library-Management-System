-->  Library Management System - User Authentication

This Python script implements a user authentication system for a Library Management System using Tkinter for the GUI. It allows users to log in, register as a new user, and reset their password if forgotten. The script connects to a MySQL database to perform user authentication and password management tasks. Users can log in with their username and password, and if the credentials are correct, they gain access to the library system. If the user forgets their password, they can reset it by providing their contact number and setting a new password. The application provides appropriate error messages for invalid input and ensures data integrity by validating user inputs before performing database operations.
